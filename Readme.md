# Orchard Core SaaS module Readme



## Project Description

A sample Orchard Core module containing a logic where users can create their own tenants by filling a form. They need to provide an email address, the name of the site and a handle. After they get an email with a link containing these values. Clicking on this link will set up the new tenant with the predefined settings.

This project is based on an Orchard Core demo by [SÃ©baestien Ros](https://github.com/sebastienros/), the recording of the demo is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEj-oOVVOLE).
